# 10/06/2023 We need to talk about monetization

I don't like the attitude that someone else should pay for it or that it should always be free. If something is free, you're relying on the donation of someone else's time or resources. That's not sustainable.

On the internet, I feel people don't like monetization. A mass of people represents a fire hose of users spending, attention and data: that is extremely valuable. It's just poorly directed at where it can do the most good.

Everybody has costs. A very small website costs at least $3 a month. People enjoy using services for free and are extremely fast to abandon when the site or app begins to become non-free. 

In the open source world, people expect open source developers to do what they want them to do, not allow the open source developer to do what they want.

How can you charge money before you've demonstrated value?

 





# 08/06/2023 NixOS and Guix are stamp collecting



# 06/06/2023 The computer industry has gone the way of the hifi industry



# 02/06/2023 Standards are high in aggregate but individual contribution standards are low

Businesses want someone with 15 years experience for something that has only existed for 10. The standards of Job Descriptions are very high. They represent a "T" shaped person, someone who is good at everything. Teams are asked what kind of person are they looking for and they get the perfect description of someone good at everything.





# 02/06/2023 Each abstraction brings its own problems or added complexity



# 01/06/2023 When a language is insufficiently advanced for what you want to do, most devs push through

# 31/05/2023 Isolated Ecosystems are size limited based on the amount of work that needs doing

Each programming language ecosystem is limited in its size because of the amount of work that needs doing to support it. Each language brings its own [orthogonals](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas4#542-orthogonality-ontology-as-a-primitive-and-asts-bidirectional-compilation) of interactions between its type system, garbage collection, the stack, semantics. It's easier to create a language than read the implementation of someone else's.

# 22/05/2023 Neural networks and LLMs are function discovery for human words

It must be obvious to others, but neural networks discover functions through relationships.



# 14/05/2023 Everyone has their own Frameworks

It would seem that everyone has their own way of thinking about problems and solving problems. We see many frameworks that are particular ways of looking at things.

# 14/05/2023 The problem with searching for a beautiful elegant solution



# 05/05/2023 If you look at IT history you can see that many ideas didn't turn out as intended

* Java Applets didn't dominate the web, Flash did.
* REST and HATEOAS didn't work as intended - everyone implements REST differently and there is no standard client for browsing REST APIs. WSDL and Soap never gained the same level of popularity as REST.
* It seems UML is meant to make software readily and easily documentable and generatable.
* XML was a serialization format that would be standardised and everyone could use schemas to designate what data they accept and it could be validated. Even XML databases existed.

# 03/05/2023 One large problem in IT is how to rate control your spending on IT

If you have no money coming in, how can you do things properly? You don't have resources to buy servers, rent servers.

# 03/05/2023 I want to see a big tech giants do business software

The Amazon AWS strategy of adding services and standardising them on state of the art platform is really interesting. This model should be picked up by other big tech giants.



# 21/04/2023 We need an Large Language Model for software architecture

Large Language Models can transform and manipulate tokens meaningfully because they understand the relationships between vectors. They can explore vector space of concepts semantically.

Now we need to represent potential software models with a LLM and then be capable of transforming them. Imagine being capable of transforming your software architecture with a prompt?
