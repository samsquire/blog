It would seem that everyone has their own way of thinking about problems and solving problems. We see many frameworks that are particular ways of looking at things.

# 05/05/2023 If you look at IT history you can see that many ideas didn't turn out as intended

# 21/04/2023 We need an Large Language Model for software architecture

Large Language Models can transform and manipulate tokens meaningfully because they understand the relationships between vectors. They can explore vector space of concepts semantically.

Now we need to represent potential software models with a LLM and then be capable of transforming them. Imagine being capable of transforming your software architecture with a prompt?
